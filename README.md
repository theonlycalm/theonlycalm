### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Iush**](), a web design engineer based in Nepal.

I love turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code, you’ll find me watching anime, hitting the gym, or playing guitar. I also enjoy writing [Poetry]() and share some of them on social media.

#### Fun Facts:

* I don’t like tea.
*I’m a self-taught dev who believes in *learning by doing* and *failing forward*.
