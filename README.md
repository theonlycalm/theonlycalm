## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Iush, a frontend design engineer based in Nepal.

I love turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code, youâ€™ll find me watching anime, hitting the gym, playing guitar. I also enjoy writing poems and sharing some of them on social media.

Fun Facts:
<ul>
  <li>A self-taught dev.</li>
  <li>Demon Slayer is my favorite anime.</li>
</ul>
